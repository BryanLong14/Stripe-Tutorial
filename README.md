# Stripe API Integration Tutorial

## Description of Tutorial and Technology Used

* This is a Stripe API Integration Tutorial using Node and Express. 
* The application is deployed to Heroku. 
* This code utilizes [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/checkout)
* This code uses Handlebars, but you could easily use React, Vue, or another frontend framework in place of Handlebars to componentize your application.

## Live Site
* I made this Checkout Tutorial for a Mobile App I recently build called [_Can I Eat That?_](https://github.com/BryanLong14/Can-I-Eat-That-Frontend-Capstone-Project)
* Check out the [live site utilizing Stripe's Test Code](https://quiet-coast-55853.herokuapp.com/)
